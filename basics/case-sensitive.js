/*JavaScript is case-sensitive and uses the Unicode character set. 
For example, the word Osirawende (which means "early in the morning" in Luo) 
could be used as a variable name.
**/

Var Osirawende = 'foobar';

//but the variable osirawende is not the same as Osirawende because javascricpt is case sensitive.
